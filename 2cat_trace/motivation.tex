\section{Motivation of this chapter}
In this chapter, we give a trace functor 
on $\underline{C}$, the 2-category 
introduced in Equation 
\ref{eq:2-cat}. This trace functor enriches 
the categorical structure on algebras by 
incorporating the action on Hochschild 
cohomology ($HH^0$) on Hochschild homology 
($HH_0$). We start with Kaledin's definition 
of a trace functor on a 2-category.

In preparation of Section \ref{sec:}, we 
generalize Kaledin's definition to a 
trace functor on a category in dg cocategories 
in Section \ref{sec:}.
