Big To Do's:

1) signs
- signs for Eq B.4, B.6
- signs for proof of Prop B.5

2) Intro/Context, abstract
- background and motivation
- alg in algs: apply cobar/use MS, get an action of an explicit model of E2
--------
Background I need:
- conilp + counital --> coproduct lands in finite sums (maybe using a cofree adjunction?)
- cofree comodules over cocategories
- conilp implies unique counits
- NOTE: we prove the pb/pf adjunction for hom SETS--do we need more?
----------
Edit:
-fix figure references to label captions
-check finite vs infinite sums
- check formulas for consistent notation and indexing
- check margins
- include vs input
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246/when-should-i-use-input-vs-include
- functor vs dg functor???

List of notation:
-Lambda
-sweedler notation
-ground field k
[1] = shift up
1 in k
