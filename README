Might do:
1) add more to intro, abstract
- alg in algs: apply cobar/use MS, get an action of an explicit model of E2

Background I need:
- conilp + counital --> coproduct lands in finite sums (maybe using a cofree adjunction?)
- cofree comodules over cocategories
- conilp implies unique counits
- NOTE: we prove the pb/pf adjunction for hom SETS--do we need more?
