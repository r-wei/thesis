Big To Do's:
1) transparent description:
-homotopies/relations between lambda shrieks

**notation on computational props

2) infinity categorical description
- resolution of cyclic category

3) apply cobar and adjunctions

4) define braces and signs (functor on conilp, coaug)

5) background and motivation
- alg in algs: apply cobar/use MS, get an action of an explicit model of E2
--------
Background I need:
- conilp + counital --> coproduct lands in finite sums (maybe using a cofree adjunction?)
- cofree comodules over cocategories
- conilp implies unique counits
- NOTE: we prove the pb/pf adjunction for hom SETS--do we need more?
----------
Edit:
-fix figure references to label captions
-check finite vs infinite sums
- check formulas for consistent notation and indexing
- check margins
- include vs input
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246/when-should-i-use-input-vs-include
- functor vs dg functor???

List of notation:
-Lambda
-sweedler notation
-ground field k
