To Do:
- acknowledgements
- check for broken refs and citations (braces are assoc, check \cite{T})
- intro: describe what's in the rest of the sections
- intro: future directions? --- alg in algs: apply cobar/use MS, get an action of an explicit model of E2
- references
- lambda notation 
---------
Writing chunks:
(1) pullback appendix
- pullbacks of dg comodules--theory (everything)
- adjunction between pullback and pushforward (everything)
- pullback_examples_needed 
- our cocategories and comodules are conilpotent

(4) coda: rectification, cobar
---------
Edit (try submitting first):
- check formulas for consistent notation and indexing
- check margins
- include vs input

--------
Background I need:
- conilp + counital --> coproduct lands in finite sums (maybe using a cofree adjunction?)
- cofree comodules over cocategories
- conilp implies unique counits
- NOTE: we prove the pb/pf adjunction for hom SETS--do we need more?
