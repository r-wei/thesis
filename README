Big To Do's:

1) Intro/Context, abstract
- background and motivation
- alg in algs: apply cobar/use MS, get an action of an explicit model of E2
--------
Background I need:
- conilp + counital --> coproduct lands in finite sums (maybe using a cofree adjunction?)
- cofree comodules over cocategories
- conilp implies unique counits
- NOTE: we prove the pb/pf adjunction for hom SETS--do we need more?
----------
Edit:
- check formulas for consistent notation and indexing
- check margins
- include vs input
