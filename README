Writing chunks:
(3) intro
- describe what's in the rest of the sections
- future directions? --- alg in algs: apply cobar/use MS, get an action of an explicit model of E2

(4) references
---------
Edit:
- lambda notation 
- check for broken refs and citations (braces are assoc, check \cite{T})
- check margins
- include vs input

--------
Background I need:
- conilp + counital --> coproduct lands in finite sums (maybe using a cofree adjunction?)
- cofree comodules over cocategories
- conilp implies unique counits
- NOTE: we prove the pb/pf adjunction for hom SETS--do we need more?
