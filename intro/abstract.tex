In 2008, Dolgushev, Tamarkin and Tsygan showed that, for $M$ a smooth real manifold, the pair $(\textrm{Hochschild cochains }C^\bullet(C^\infty(M)), \textrm{ Hochschild chains }C_\bullet(C^\infty(M)))$ is quasi-isomorphic as an $\infty$-calculus algebra to $(\Lambda^\bullet(T_M), \Omega^\bullet(M))$. In this thesis, we use their $\infty$-calculus structure on Hochschild cochains and chains to construct a $``$homotopically sheafy-cyclic object in dg categories with a dg module'', i.e., an $A_\infty$-functor $\chi_\infty \to \mathcal{E}_\infty$. To give a sheafy-cyclic object is to give a dg functor out of $\chi_\infty$, a category fibred over Connes' cyclic category with fibre category $\chi_{\infty [n]} =$ the discrete category on the set of objects $\{\textrm{diagrams }A_0 \to \dots \to A_n \to A_0: A_i \textrm{ is an algebra} \}$. $\mathcal{E}_\infty$ is the dg category of objects small dg categories with a dg module, and morphisms given by a dg functor between dg categories with a (not necessarily graded) linear map from the source module to a pullback along the functor of the target module. Interestingly, in the construction of our $A_\infty$-functor, the formulas we give for cyclically rotating a dg module resemble the Lie derivative of Hochschild cochains on chains, and the homotopy between the image of $\tau_n^{n+1}$ and the image of identity resembles the $B$ operator, the analogue of the deRham differential on Hochschild chains.
