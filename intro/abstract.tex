Algebras and their bimodules form a 2-category in which 2-morphisms are certain zero-th Hochschild cohomology groups. When we derive this structure (i.e., use Hochschild cochains instead of $HH^0$ for 2-morphisms), we find that algebras form a category in dg cocategories. The Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem and non-commutative calculus give a rich algebraic structure on Hochschild cohomology along with Hochschild homology. When incorporating the structure on Hochschild homology, we find that algebras form a 2-category with a trace functor. Deriving this again, we conclude that algebras form a category in dg cocategories with a trace functor up to homotopy.
