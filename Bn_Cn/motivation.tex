\section{Motivation of this chapter}
In this chapter, we introduce the main 
characters/objects of study, $B(n)$ and 
$C(n)$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The $B(n)$'s are 
dg cocategories constructed using 
Hochschild cochains. Each $C(n)$ is a dg 
comodule over $B(n)$ constructed using 
an action of Hochschild cochains on 
Hochschild chains. 
We start with definitions for the 
less-widely-used concepts, and show 
that the main characters are 
conilpotent.

See Appendix 
\ref{chap:hochschild} for definitions of 
known operations on Hochschild chains and 
cochains as well as our notation and  
conventions.
