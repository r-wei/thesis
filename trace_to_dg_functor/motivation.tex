\section{Motivation of this chapter}
The purpose of this chapter is to 
show that a trace functor $T$ on a 
category $\mathcal{C}$ in dg cocategories 
gives a dg functor $\mathcal{F}: 
\chi(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathcal{D}$ where 
$\chi(\mathcal{C})$ and 
$\mathcal{D}$ are dg categories 
introduced in Sections \ref{sec:} and 
\ref{sec:}, respectively. We switch from 
the trace functor $T$ to the dg functor 
$\mathcal{F}$ so that we can make 
precise the notion of a $``$trace 
functor up to homotopy''. Namely, a 
trace functor on $\mathcal{C}$ up to homotopy 
is an $A_\infty$-functor from 
$\chi(\mathcal{C})$ to $\mathcal{D}$. 
We will then give such an $A_\infty$-functor 
for $\mathcal{C}$ being the category 
given in Equation \ref{eq:cat_in_dgcocat} 
(see Section \ref{sec:}).
