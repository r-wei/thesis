\chapter{Pullbacks, Pushforwards and an Adjunction} \label{chap:pullbacks}
%
In the first section of this appendix, 
we give the definition 
of the natural pullback used for dg 
comodules and show that it satisfies 
Equation \ref{eq:pullback_yoga} 
(Proposition \ref{prop:pbs_compose}). We also prove 
a useful Proposition \ref{prop:compute_pb}
describing the pullbacks of cofree dg 
comodules in terms of cogenerators. 
We then use Proposition \ref{prop:compute_pb}
to compute some examples of pullbacks.

In Section \ref{sec:cobar_ref}, we show that our 
pullback is right adjoint to a  
pushforward. This adjunction is used in 
Section \ref{sec:coda} when passing from 
dg cocategories and dg comodules to dg 
categories and dg modules. Use of this 
adjunction is not central to our 
narrative, and may perhaps become 
unnecessary as understanding of the 
structure on dg categories and dg modules 
evolves.

A technical detail in all of this is that 
we work with conilpotent dg comodules over 
conilpotent dg cocategories. We discuss these 
details in Section \ref{sec:conilpotence}.
